=head1 getGOEnrichment

Example:

    getGOEnrichment [arguments] < input > output

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the identifer. If another column contains the identifier
use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the identifier.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.

=head2 Documentation for underlying call

For a given list of Features from a particular genome (for example "Athaliana" ) find out the significantly enriched GO terms in your feature-set. This function accepts five parameters: Species name, a list of gene-identifiers, a list of ontology domains, a list of evidence codes, and test type (e.g. "hypergeometric" and "chisq"). The list of gene identifiers cannot be empty; however the list of ontology domains and the list of evidence codes can be empty. If any of these two lists is not empty then the gene-id and the go-id pairs retrieved from KBase are further filtered by using the desired ontology domains and/or evidence codes supplied as input. So, if you don't want to filter the initial results then it is recommended to provide empty domain and evidence code lists. Final filtered list of the gene-id to go-ids mapping is used to calculate GO Enrichment using hypergeometric or chi-square test.

=item -c Column

This is used only if the column containing the identifier is not the last column.

=item -i InputFile    [ use InputFile, rather than stdin ]

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with extra columns added.

Input lines that cannot be extended are written to stderr.
