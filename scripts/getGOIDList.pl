=head1 getGOIDList

Example:

    getGOIDList [arguments] < input > output

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the identifer. If another column contains the identifier
use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the identifier.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.

=head2 Documentation for underlying call

This script is a wrapper for the CDMI-API call getGOIDList. It is documented as follows:

For a given list of Features (aka Genes) from a particular genome (for example "Athaliana" Arabidopsis thaliana ) extract corresponding list of GO identifiers. This function call accepts four parameters: species name, a list of gene-identifiers, a list of ontology domains, and a list of evidence codes. The list of gene identifiers cannot be empty; however the list of ontology domains and the list of evidence codes can be empty. If any of the last two lists is not empty then the gene-id and go-id pairs retrieved from KBase are further filtered by using the desired ontology domains and/or evidence codes supplied as input. So, if you don't want to filter the initial results then it is recommended to provide empty domain and evidence code lists. Finally, this function returns a mapping of gene-id to go-ids; note that in the returned table of results, each gene-id is associated with a list of one of more go-ids. Also, a note on the input list: only one item per line is allowed.

This is used only if the column containing the identifier is not the last column.

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with extra columns added.

Input lines that cannot be extended are written to stderr.
